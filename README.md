Pterodactyl eggs - Vice City Multiplayer

> This egg is running in our production, we will keep it well maintained and up to date.

## How to use
Just simply import `vc-mp-egg.json` to your panel and then you can create a server.

**For convenience, I additionally packed a zip file containing default scripts and official and latest plugins for installation called `server.zip` in this repository**
